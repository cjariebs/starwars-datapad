## "API Hack" Capstone Project for Thinkful Full Stack Flex

Using the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co), display a digital storefront
for buying and selling Vehicles and Starships.

Initial implementation:
1. Display a list of available Vehicles and Starships.
2. Implement a basic User "Wallet" that stores Credits.
3. "Buying" a vehicle deducts from the Wallet.
